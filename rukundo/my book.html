<p>SYSTEM ANALYSIS
<p>TOPIC: Web Based Restaurant Management System</p>


<p>INTRODUCTION:</p> 
<p>amikus is a restaurant which located near Virunga hotel in Musanze district. Currently they are offering their services to large number of customers daily. Their customer base is growing day by day because of their location and quality of their food. Even though this is a small restaurant, the service they are offering is huge:
With the growing customer base, it is difficult to offer services to all of them manually. Therefore, this restaurant requires to move to a computerized solution. This will help to run their operations smoothly and in more efficient manner.
PROBLEM: "AMIKUS" is a food store located in Musanze district. Their process is currently manual and time consuming. Customer cannot order food online, before they visit the restaurant. They have to visit the restaurant and place the order. Then they have to wait until the order is ready. There is no visual confirmation that the order was placed correctly.
Customers can not ensure about the correctness of their order. Order customization is also difficult because it takes more time. Table reservation is also difficult. This restaurant is very busy in the morning and evening after 6 pm because the
restaurant is located in a very attractive place, near Godagama expressway interchange. Therefore, the restaurant is always full. Currently customers have to come to the restaurant to reserve a table. Sometimes customers have to wait long time to reserve a table during busy times. Also, very long queues are there. It is difficult for the cashier to handle such a situation. On the other hand, 2 this situation is difficult for the kitchen also. They are receiving orders one by one. Sometimes kitchen is
receiving same food item within separate orders in same time.</p>

<p>SOLUTION: Online system that proposed here will simplify the ordering process and it will be helpful to both restaurant and customer. The proposed system will be developed with interactive menus, pop-up messages etc. for the easiness of the user. Customer can select the required food item with available customizations and the can change the order at any time before checking out online. If order is confirmed, it will display a pop-up message as confirmation to the customer. When the order is placed it's recorded in the database and retrieved in real time manner. Through this option Restaurant Employees are
allowed to quickly go through the orders which they have received.
Therefore, they can process all orders efficiently and effectively with minimal delays and confusion.
GENERAL OBJECTIVE: Proposed system is valuable for both customer and the restaurant because it is simplifying the order processing process. Through better application of daily operations restaurant can increase the efficiency and can offer
improved services to the customers. Because almost all processes are manual and time consuming, all the processes should be automated. The Main Objective: To build a web based restaurant management system for "AMIKUS" Restaurant.</p>

<p>SPACE REQUIREMENTS:
	Software Size: The size of the software itself, including the web application files, images, scripts, and any other necessary components, will contribute to the space requirements. This can typically range from a few megabytes to several gigabytes, depending on the system's functionality and the technology stack used for development.</p>

	Database Size: If the restaurant management system includes a database to store information such as menu items, orders, customer data, and inventory, the size of the database will also contribute to the space requirements.<br>

Media Storage: If the system includes features that require storing media files, such as images or videos for menu items or promotional materials, the space requirements will increase accordingly. The amount of media storage needed will depend on factors such as the number of items and the size of the media files being stored.<br>


<p>ORGANIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
	User Roles and Permissions: Define different user roles within the system, such as administrators, managers, waitstaff, kitchen staff, and customers. Each role should have specific permissions and access levels to perform their respective tasks. This ensures proper data security, confidentiality, and accountability.</p>

	Hierarchical Structure: Establish a hierarchical structure within the system to reflect the organizational structure of the restaurant. This may include sections for different departments, such as front of house, kitchen, inventory management, and accounting. This structure aids in organizing tasks, responsibilities, and information.<br>

	Centralized Data Management: Implement a centralized database to store and manage all relevant data, including menu items, orders, customer information, inventory, and financial records.<br>
 
<p>IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
